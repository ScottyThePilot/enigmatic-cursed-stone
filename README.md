# Enigmatic Cursed Stone

Adds a new item, the Cursed Stone to be used in Enigmatic Legacy.
Currently, this item is unobtainable, but can be used to craft the Ring of the
Seven Curses and the Enigmatic Amulet, as well as re-roll the Enigmatic Amulet.
Additionally, players' starting gear will have the Ring of the Seven Curses
replaced with a Cursed Stone.
